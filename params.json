Both the TIFF and Exif metadata are arranged in a list of tagged items in the file. This viewer prints out all items in the order that they occur and lists their contents, even if it doesn't understand the contents. This allows even obscure items to be seen that may be ignored by other metadata readers.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
